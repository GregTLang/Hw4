1. Of the 576 active players, the majority are high school/college aged men (84% male and 67% ages 15 to 24) 2. The average price of items on the "most popular" list was 20% lower than the average price of items on the "most profitable" list ($3.65 v $4.59) highlighting that there is not significant purchase volume of less-expensive items 3. The average item purchase price of the top five spenders is $4.01. This relatively high item price highlights player inclination to purchase more expensive items rather than a high quantity of less expensive items (e.g. the Cudgel of Necromancy costing $1.02) and suggests that there is little sensitivity to price when it comes to the population of active players who spend money on in-game purchases
